# Random Forest Classifier on OCR Dataset

This repository implements a Random Forest Classifier for handwritten character recognition using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) dataset from Scikit Learn Python Library. The project demonstrates how ensemble learning can be applied to achieve robust performance in text recognition tasks.

### Features

- Preprocessing of OCR dataset (cleaning & feature extraction)
- Training and tuning a Random Forest Classifier
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Example predictions on test samples

### Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
